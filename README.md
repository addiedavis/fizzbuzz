# FizzBuzz

An introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD) exercise

## Rules of FizzBuzz
- read in a number greater than 0
- return back that number unless 
	- the number is divisible by 3 return "FIZZ"
	- the number is divisible by 5 return "BUZZ"
	- the number is divisible by 3 and 5 return "FIZZBUZZ"

## Rules of TDD 
- start with the test
- you cannot write any production unless it is to fix a failure in the test in the simplest way possible
- you cannot write any more of a test then what gets to a failure
failures are syntax errors or a red test
- Red, Green, Refactor
